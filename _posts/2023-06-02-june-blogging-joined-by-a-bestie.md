After months and months of putting off actually publishing my writing online, I've decided to attempt to post a blog every day for the month of June. Joining me for mutual accountability is Kyle Anthony Williams (a classmate of mine in MIT's class of 2027) on his blog at [https://kawcco.com/](https://kawcco.com/). Hopefully, by July, we'll have written at least 60 posts (combined) and gotten better at putting our thoughts in writing and not letting minor flaws in said writing hold us back from sharing it.
## A preview of what's to come:
I plan on using this month to write about things that I've done with programming; those that I've always thought casually about, but never bothered to properly figure out; and those that I happen to notice that day and decide to just write about on the spot. However, you can expect some of the following to appear at some point or another:
- Programming
  - A love-hate relationship with the Rust programming language
  - Tales of fighting frameworks and networks in a quest to do one (1) simple task
- Linguistics
  - Words for nerds, word games, made-up words, and all such manner of things
- Films and Anime
  - My two favourite forms of fiction media
  - "Wow, I should really write about [piece of media] and inflict my thoughts about it onto an unsuspecting audience!" â†’ blog post :)

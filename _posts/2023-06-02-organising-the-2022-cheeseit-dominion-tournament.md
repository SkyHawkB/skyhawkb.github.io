september 2019: people talking about nyc in world-cup

september 2019: truffles starts organising truffleit (interest form, rsvp, etc)

16 november 2019: truffleit happened! it was fantastic

then some things happened that hampered in-person gatherings... until

february 2022: i polled for interest in the tournaments chat and got it

april 2022: i revived the channel :D

posted an interest form to collect days + people + available cards

joked about getting sponsored by cheezit

after a few days, picked the most popular day and posted rsvp form

started looking at venues, got a nice studio on peerspace ($500 :0)

purchased sticker nametags, sharpies, and pens

made a results sheet in the same manner as for online, but collected scores on paper slips for ease of play

bot announces scores in discord for people to follow along

we all got together and had a good time!

got a bit of financial support via kofi
